## Selected Projects

**2025 – Demand-Based Asset Pricing with LLMs**  
Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5 3B via GRPO to simulate behaviour of 3 600 major investors (≈ 68 % US market) in a demand-based pricing system.

**2024 – Municipality-Level Energy-Retrofit Analysis (NO)**  
Showcased the impact of the building types on the quantity of retrofits, with multi-dwellings coefficient = −3.6, *p* = 0.003.

**2024 – Greeks & Risk Management**  
Provided an in-depth look at how the Greeks are derived from Black–Scholes, computed analytically for European options, and
used to hedge portfolios in real markets. Explored real-world limitations, such as time-varying volatility, transaction costs.
