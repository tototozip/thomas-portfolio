My semester project at EPFL investigates how **random graph models** capture the structure of complex networks and how we can **recover latent communities and parameters** from a single network snapshot.

* Survey of ER, Configuration, SBM, DCSBM, MMSBM & ERGM  
* Graph limits and graphon theory (Szemerédi’s regularity lemma)  
* Practical inference: spectral clustering, MLE, modularity, network histograms  
* MATLAB demos & Python notebooks illustrating each method
