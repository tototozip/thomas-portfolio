This semester paper combines **ENOVA subsidy records** with Statistics Norway socio-economic data to explain why some municipalities embrace energy-saving retrofits while others lag behind.

* Panel dataset: 356 municipalities × 8 years  
* Overdispersion handled via **Negative Binomial** and two-way fixed effects  
* Key finding: higher shares of multi-dwelling buildings substantially **reduce** retrofit counts, even after controlling for income, education, and subsidy generosity  
* Policy implication: tailor incentives to apartment blocks and denser regions
