lead_text: "Instead of asking an LLM to “guess the stock price,” this part embeds it into a full asset-pricing framework: the model predicts institutional demand from fundamentals, which then implies prices. The results show fine-tuning boosts demand forecasts, but translating them into consistently superior price predictions remains elusive. (First part of the paper linked.)"
