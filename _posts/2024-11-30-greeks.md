This research paper, completed for my ETH Zurich Applied‑Math master’s, walks through the Black‑Scholes framework, derives closed‑form expressions for the five major Greeks, and demonstrates delta, gamma, vega, and theta hedging with Python examples. It concludes with a discussion of model limitations such as volatility smiles and market frictions.
