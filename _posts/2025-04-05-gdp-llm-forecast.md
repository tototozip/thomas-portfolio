Ongoing project: using **Chronos** (time-series–aware GPT) fine-tuned on IMF & World Bank data to generate quarterly NGDP predictions and confidence intervals.  

* Benchmarks: ARIMA, VAR, LSTM  
* Prompt engineering for chain-of-thought reasoning over economic releases  
* Early results: 14 % lower MAE vs WEO consensus on 2021-24 back-test

Full write-up and code will be published once the model is finalized.
